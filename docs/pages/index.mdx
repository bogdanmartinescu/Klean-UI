# Getting Started with Klean-UI

Welcome to **Klean-UI**, a modern, lightweight, and highly customizable UI component library built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Klean-UI aims to provide a robust set of components that are easy to use, extend, and theme, helping you build beautiful and consistent user interfaces effortlessly.

## Installation

To get started with Klean-UI, you need to install the library via npm or yarn. You can add Klean-UI to your project by running the following command:

```sh

# Using npm

npm install klean-ui

# Using yarn

yarn add klean-ui
```

## Setup

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

Klean-UI uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensure that Tailwind CSS is set up in your project. If you haven't set up Tailwind CSS yet, you can follow the [official Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Theme Configuration

Klean-UI supports dynamic theming. You can load themes dynamically using the `loadTheme` utility. Add the following to your project to load the default theme:

```typescript
import { loadTheme } from "klean-ui/utils/loadTheme";

loadTheme("default");
```

Ensure you have a `themes.json` file in your project root to define your themes:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "path": "styles/globals.css",
    "description": "Default theme"
  },
  "green": {
    "path": "styles/green.css",
    "description": "Green theme"
  }
}
```

## Usage

Klean-UI provides a variety of components. Hereâ€™s a simple example of using a Button component:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "klean-ui";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## CLI Tool

Klean-UI includes a CLI tool to help you add and configure components easily. After installing Klean-UI, you can use the CLI to add components:

```sh
npx klean-ui add button
```

This command will download the Button component and place it in your `components` folder.
